# *Optimal reporter assignment*

This project is a C++ application that performs file manipulation tasks, including reading, writing, and processing files. It is modularly designed with multiple components to ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

## *Project Structure*

The project consists of the following files:

### *Source Files*
- main.cpp: The main entry point of the program where different components interact.
- article.cpp: Handles logic for processing article-related data.
- filereader.cpp: Contains the functionality for reading from files.
- filewriter.cpp: Contains the functionality for writing to files.
- solution.cpp: Implements the core solution or processing logic.

### *Header Files*
- article.h: Declares the structure and interfaces for handling article-related data.
- filereader.h: Declares the interfaces for file reading functionalities.
- filewriter.h: Declares the interfaces for file writing functionalities.
- solution.h: Declares the core solution or processing logic.

### *Build System*
- Makefile: Contains the instructions to compile the program using the make command.

## *Dependencies*
- A C++ compiler such as g++.
- Standard C++ libraries.
- Make tool for building the project.

## *Setup and Compilation*

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. To compile the project, run the following command:

   ```bash
   make
After successful compilation, an executable will be generated. To run the program, use:

bash
Copy code
./<executable_name>
Usage
The program expects input files for processing.
Modify the input files as required, and place them in the designated directory.
The program will output results to a file, which can be viewed after execution.
Functions and Classes
FileReader (filereader.cpp)
This class is responsible for reading content from input files.

Methods:
readFile(const std::string& filename): Reads data from the specified file and returns the content.
FileWriter (filewriter.cpp)
This class handles writing content to output files.

Methods:
writeFile(const std::string& filename, const std::string& content): Writes the given content to the specified file.
Article (article.cpp)
Handles operations related to articles, potentially for processing and storing article-related data.

Methods:
Functions for parsing, managing, and processing article data.
Solution (solution.cpp)
Implements the core logic for processing the input data and generating solutions.

Methods:
solve(): Contains the main algorithm that processes the input and returns the results.
